Welcome to the user's documentation for the program derivative.
This application will find the derivative form of your function.

Menu:
    1) This option will let you input your function and displays it's derivative form.
    2) Displays simplified version of this document for use from within the program.
    3) Let's you displays or erase the log.
    4) Displays general information about the program.
    5) Shows some example functions to demonstrate some kinds of the input
       from within the program.
       
Input:
    Use raw function body as your input, for example:
        'sin(x)'        will be processed
        'y = sin(x)'    won't be processed
        'f(x) = sin(x)' won't be processed
        
    The program can calculate derivative of functions consisting of some basic elementary
    functions:
         > sine            = sin(x)       > exponential      = exp(x)
         > cosine          = cos(x)       > nat. logarithm   = ln(x)
         > tangent         = tan(x)       > power            = a^b or pow(a,b) where a,b are numbers, functions or constants
         > cotangent       = cot(x)
         > secant          = sec(x)
         > cosecant        = csc(x)
         > arcsine         = arcsin(x)    (inverse function to: sine
         > arccosine       = arcarccos(x)                       cosine
         > arctangent      = arctan(x)                          tanget
         > arccotangent    = arccot(x)                          cotangent)
         > hyperbolic sine = sinh(x)
         > hyp. cosine     = cosh(x)
         > hyp. tangent    = tanh(x)
         > hyp. cotangent  = coth(x)
         > hyp. secant     = sech(x)
         > hyp. cosecant   = csc(x)  
    
    If you want to make a composed function, simply use function1(function2(x)) (more levels of composition are allowed).
    Operations in your functions supported are addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
    and composition (as noted above).
    Note: The program deletes any spaces you enter, so 'cos( x ) + sin ( x )' = 'cos(x)+sin(x)'.
